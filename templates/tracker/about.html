          StudyStar was created with one goal in mind — to make studying feel less overwhelming
          and more empowering. We understand that motivation doesn’t always come easily, and
          that success is built on small, consistent steps.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          Our mission is to help students, professionals, and lifelong learners stay accountable,
          organised, and confident in their progress. With simple tools for tracking goals,
          logging study sessions, and reviewing your growth over time, StudyStar turns your
          effort into momentum.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Whether you’re returning to education, pursuing professional development, or studying
          out of pure curiosity — you deserve a space that supports your focus and celebrates
          your achievements.
